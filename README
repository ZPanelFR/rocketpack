What is RocketPack?
-------------------
RocketPack is a simple, light-weight, easy to learn and code-on PHP MVC framework that aims to help you build robust, secure and stable web applications in very little time!


Why RocketPack was developed
----------------------------
RocketPack was developed by myself Bobby Allen (bobbyallen.uk@gmail.com) mainly for my own personal use, I do a lot of PHP development and believe that by developing a single PHP framework I could save hundreds of hours a year by not having to re-write code!

I recently played with Ruby on Rails, I loved 'most' of the ways it works but I felt some of it was too simple and some of the syntax I felt didn't always follow suit and make sense although most of the time it did. I also feel that PHP is the future, I prefer working with PHP as firstly it is my first proper web application language but also as PHP is ran on most of the worlds web servers I personally believe it makes sense! Ruby on Rails is a pain to setup correctly and to have it hosted requires a little more than your normal web host generally offers.
