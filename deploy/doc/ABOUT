RocketPack is a web application framework developed for PHP, it is designed to
be light-weight, super quick and help you write applications in less time.

RocketPack provides a simply MVC platform and a load of 'helper' classes and a
standard directory structure to aid you write applications quickly as 
well as provide a framework which you can use over and over again for all your
projects.

RocketPack is designed to be used by developers, RocketPack isn't designed so
you don't have to write any code, RocketPack is for developers to develop on,
therefore you WILL require prior knowledge of PHP.

About the root directory structure:-
====================================

/app    - Directory contain all your application specific files, images etc.
/config - Contains the RocketPack framework configuration.
/doc    - RocketPack documentation.
/lib    - RocketPack core classes.
/log    - The default 'log' folder, unless changed in your app.conf.php file all
          application logs will be written here.
/tmp    - The default 'tmp' folder, unless changed in your app.conf.php file
          this folder will be used when required by the framework as a temporary
          directory for file uploads etc.

By using the above directory structure your application resides in '/app' only
meaning it is super portable and you can upgrade your framework super easily!

About the /app/ directory structure:-
=====================================

/app/
    assets/         - The main 'public assets' folder.
      /images/      - The default image storage area.

    libraries/      - An optional folder which can be used for storing third-
                      party PHP classes (classes in this folder will auto-load
                      by default.)
    models/         - An optional folder which is used (classes will auto-load
                      from this directory by default) and enables you to add

                      are 'rendered' by the controller.

                      resides in the /config/ folder.
