          <h2>What is RocketPack?</h2>

<p>RocketPack is a simple, light-weight, easy to learn and code-on PHP MVC framework that aims to help you build robust, secure and stable web applications in very little time!</p>

<h2>Why RocketPack was developed</h2>

<p>RocketPack was developed by myself, Bobby Allen (<a href="mailto:bobbyallen.uk@gmail.com">bobbyallen.uk@gmail.com</a>) mainly for my own personal use, I do a lot of PHP development and believe that by developing a single PHP framework I could save hundreds of hours a year by not having to re-write code!</p>

<p>I recently played with Ruby on Rails, I loved 'most' of the ways it works but I felt some of it was too simple and some of the syntax I felt didn't always follow suit and make sense although most of the time it did. I also feel that PHP is the future, I prefer working with PHP as firstly it is my first proper web application language but also as PHP is ran on most of the worlds web servers I personally believe it makes sense! Ruby on Rails is a pain to setup correctly and to have it hosted requires a little more than your normal web host generally offers.</p>

<h2>Getting started..</h2>

<p>Once you've grabbed your copy of RocketPack you need to make a few configuration changes to match your enviroment, these are as follows:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Edit and customise your application settings in config.php, you may want to enable the use of mod_rewrite etc.</li>
<li>If you are using RocketPack from a directory on your machine other than '/rocketpack/' you'll need to update the .htaccess file and set the correct RewriteBase path. Generally once you use RocketPack in a production enviroment you will have it hosted in the root of your domain, in this case you'd need to set the RewriteBase to '/' instead.</li>
<li>If using a Linux or UNIX based operating system you should set the appropriate directory permissions on 'cache/', 'tmp/' and 'log/' to enable your web server of choice to be able to write to these directories.</li>
<li>If you now access RocketPack from your browser like so: http://localhost/rocketpack/ you should now see a summary of things you may still need to do to finalise your applications enviroment (such as configure database connection, invalid permissions sets on folder etc.).</li>
<li>You can now empty out the default (example) controllers, models and views from the app/ directory and start developing your application. You may also want to change the 'default controller' option in config.php.</li>
</ul>
